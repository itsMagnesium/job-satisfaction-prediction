# Employee Satisfaction Analysis - TechTrend Innovations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs machine learning analysis on an [employee survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/employee-survey/data) to predict job satisfaction levels. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. This assignment was part of the **Data Mining** course taught by [**Dr. Mahmoud Amintoosi**](https://github.com/mamintoosi) at **Ferdowsi University of Mashhad** during the Spring Semester of 2025.

The goal of this assignment is to expose data manipulation by analyzing real employee satisfaction data and building a machine learning model to predict satisfaction levels. The project follows a narrative where a CEO named Mr. Bluffington has hired hackers to manipulate satisfaction scores, and we use the original data to reveal the truth.
